 Lets you fly, teleport and look around, all the good stuff
 
 I don't see any potential malicous use for this but regardless use this responsibly
 
 It gives you abilities the game otherwise does not allow with great power comes great responsibility
 
 **G** lets you move by teleporting
 **H** lets you fly around
 **J** teleports you once through several blocks
 **K** lets you move the camera around without moving the player
 **L** lets you adjust the gravity felt by the player

To use just `inject.js` paste into the javascript console or use an extension to inject the code into the website that way its running after you die or switch worlds.
